# DDoS_attack_on_SDN
This project aims to demonstrate a DDoS attack on an SDN. This project serves more on scientific investigation to analyse vulnerabilities of SDN and the impact of cyber-attacks on the network.
This project requires an understanding of OpenFlow, the ONOS controller, the network simulator called Mininet, DDoS penetration testing tools; and using these building blocks to implement a simulator of DDoS attacks against SDNs.
